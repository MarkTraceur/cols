Original code written by Mark Holmquist at the University of Redlands in 2010.

Usage examples:
  cols file1 file2 -- cut file1 to 80 columns, put the result into file2.
  cols -c 50 file1 file2 -- cut file1 to 50 columns, put the result into file2.
  cols file1 -- cut file1 to 80 columns, and replace the contents of that file with the result.
