To install:
  Currently, there is no accepted method for installing. I just make it and run it from the current directory. If you want to put it somewhere in your path, you can do so easily after you compile it.

  Compilation is as easy as `g++ -o cols cols.cpp`, so there shouldn't be any too-complicated install procedures.
